# Hotel-Booking-Prediction-ML
A ML model that predicts whether a hotel booking is likely to be cancelled or not with an accuracy of 99.3% . The model takes into account various factors. The problem we're trying to solve is whether the hotel either cancels the booking or not.
We have used many machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, knn, decision tree, random forest, catboost, xgboost, lightgbm, etc., among which Catboost Algorithm has highest level of prediction with 99.34%.
